          These are the marketing materials for Chromatica Chorale’s spring 2024
          concert. This is a choir based in Danville, CA for whom I volunteer to
          do their graphic design work. This concert was focused around a
          commissioned piece of music involving a well known composer,
          Christopher Tin, and lyricist, Charles Anthony Silvestri, so they
          wanted to do an early save the date postcard in addition to their
          normal posters with matching postcard. We made a 24 page printed
          concert booklet that was distributed during the shows. In addition to
          formatting the entire booklet and adding some creative elements, such
          as a decorative stripe along the edges of content pages (to
          distinguish them from ad pages). I also helped to create some of the
          ads or resize them from existing business cards and submitted ads.<br />These

          The marketing campaign was extremely successful. They had a much
          larger audience than their previous concerts. They printed 400
          programs, more than they usually print, but had over 550 attendees.

          These are the marketing materials for the fall 2023 concert for
          Chromatica Chorale based in Danville, CA. I am volunteering as the
          graphic designer for their fall and spring concerts this season. I
          designed this poster using their pre-existing logo, but chose and
          edited the image from a video clip I took many years ago and chose the
          layout and fonts used. I’ve been working with members of their board
          to present my ideas and get feedback on what they want; we went
          through many image and design ideas before we finalized this one.
          After finalizing the image and layout for the poster, I adapted it to
          fit on a larger poster, postcard, and ticket. I also worked on the
          design and layout for the printed brochure program handed out at the
          concerts, as well as a digital booklet program that concert goers
          could access on their phones.<br />
