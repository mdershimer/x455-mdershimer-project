          Chromatica Choral - Spring 2024 Concert

          These are the marketing materials for Chromatica Chorale’s spring 2024
          concert. This is a choir based in Danville, CA for whom I volunteer to
          do their graphic design work. This concert was focused around a
          commissioned piece of music involving a well known composer,
          Christopher Tin, and lyricist, Charles Anthony Silvestri, so they
          wanted to do an early save the date postcard in addition to their
          normal posters with matching postcard. We made a 24 page printed
          concert booklet that was distributed during the shows. In addition to
          formatting the entire booklet and adding some creative elements, such
          as a decorative stripe along the edges of content pages (to
          distinguish them from ad pages). I also helped to create some of the
          ads or resize them from existing business cards and submitted ads. The
          marketing campaign was extremely successful. They had a much larger
          audience than their previous concerts. They printed 400 programs, more
          than they usually print, but had over 550 attendees.

          I had proposed a number of design ideas for the main theme of the
          poster, finalists among those included plant life-specifically the
          process of ferns unfurling, and a rose window styled image with
          decorative elements showing the transformational life cycle of a
          butterfly, around a petaled center flower in the different colors of
          the choir’s logo. The rose window idea was deemed a little gross in
          having to look at the earlier life cycles with all the larvae and bugs
          so I proposed a photograph showing a human figure walking out of a
          dark forested area into a well lit open area, with his long shadow
          following along behind him. Since the photograph was black and white,
          this was deemed too dark of a poster overall. A board member suggested
          using a photograph of a nebula, the transformation of a star, and
          after hunting through images we ended up on this one where the colors
          had been enhanced to be bright and bold.

          Chromatica Choral - Fall 2023 Concert
        </h3>

          <img

          />
          These are the marketing materials for Chromatica’s fall 2023 concert.
          I designed this poster using their pre-existing logo, but chose and
          edited the image from a video clip I took many years ago and chose the
          layout and fonts used. The concert was about remembering, both loved
          ones who have passed and more generally songs composed with the
          intention of calling back memories. The choir wanted to evoke this
          sense of recalling the past and loved ones, but did not want the
          imagery to be sad in itself. I tried a few different ideas more
          directly evoking memories and the past, but we decided on something
          more symbolic, with light being blocked but also coming through, kind
          of like how we interact with our memories. The choir directly also
          specifically liked the empty bench in this chosen scene, because it
          was similar to the league he is a part of and how when one of their
          members passes away they leave their chair empty in their gatherings.
          If I remember correctly, the image was taken from a graveyard,
          although that is not evident in this shot. The image was chosen more
          for how it captures the light. After finalizing the image and layout
          for the poster, I adapted it to fit on a larger poster, postcard, and
          ticket. I also worked on the design and layout for the printed
          three-fold brochure program handed out at the concerts, as well as a
          digital booklet program that concert goers could access on their
          phones. The digital booklet included more details about the choir,
          lyrics for each individual song, images relating to the songs, and
          some fun tidbits about the music and sometimes how it interacted with
          other songs on the program or the other concerts the choir has
          performed.
